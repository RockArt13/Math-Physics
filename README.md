# Math-Physics
Experiments with math and physics concepts related to game programming.

# #AboutTheProject
These are mini projects. The aim is to go in-depth into mathematics, namely view vectors, matrixes, quaternions, and how to use dot product, cross product, inverse matrices, etc. 

Also, apply mathematics to physics laws of motion by looking at forces (like gravity and others) and impulses. Additionally, it covers topics like particle physics, mass-aggregate physics, rigid-body physics, collision detection, and contact physics.


Current Projects are:

## 1. Drawing
Units and conversion, Drawing by data.

## 2. Moving1
Moving and bouncing. Calculating and simulating. Simplifications and corrections

## 3. Moving2
Gravity. Environmental resistance, wind, water. Flying and collecting balls. Units and drawing homework presentation.

## 4. Bouncing
Bouncing and mass. Bouncing to the sloped border.

## 5. Ball Games
Bouncing between circles. 

## 6. Bouncing Frameworks
Animation and bouncing with frameworks.

## 7. 3d calculations
Using matrices in graphics calculations.
